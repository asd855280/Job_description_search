# Job_description_search
Current on-demand job skills search automation

This is a simple project that I wrote in python.

The target platform for job searching is 104.com in Taiwan

Input two arguments: (1)The job title that you want to search, and (2) how many pages of searching results you want

This automation will then produce a dataframe of all jobs searched, with their job description, education requirement and etc.
It will also create a barplot, which shows the count of occurance of each demanded skills in the searching results.

And the flask_104.py is just another practice on using html web server to post a form data to execute job description search
